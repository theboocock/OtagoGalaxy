This directory contains stuff needed to run Anton Enright's Tribe
algorithm, starting from a on a complete peptide set, and finishing with a
file of families that can be loaded into a family databases using
the scripts. 

The script/ directory contains sh and perl scripts. This used to be in
ensembl-external/scripts/family, but has been moved to 
ensembl-external/family/scripts.

The src/ directory contains some C-source code etc., see there. 

See ensembl-doc/family.txt for directions on how to produce a new family
set.
